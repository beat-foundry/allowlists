## Allowlists

The allowlists in this repository are established onchain for minting early during a Beat Foundry collection drop.

### shapshot_bridges.txt

The allowlist for the 404 addresses that are made up of every Oshi NFT holder as well as a majority of Ocarina holders up until 404 total
addresses. The allowlist was taken on 3/29/22 at 5pm ET and the allowlist minting period is all day on 4/11/22.

### snapshot_next.txt

The allowlist for the 161 addresses of ocarina holders that did not make it onto the Bridges snapshot. These addresses will be included, along with the holders of the next artist's NFTs, in the allowlist for minting our next collection (announcing soon).
